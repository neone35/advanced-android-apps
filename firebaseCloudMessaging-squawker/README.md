# Squawker
Squawker is a social media app where the course instructors send "Squawks" whenever the mood strikes. This app shows new server data in real time, in a battery efficient way. Uses Firebase Cloud Messenger to receive Twitter-like messages, sent from [this server](https://squawkerfcmserver.udacity.com/), in real time. 

This is the toy app for the FCM lesson of the [Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).
