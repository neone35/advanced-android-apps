# AndroidMe
AndroidMe is an app that lets you style your own Android by customizing it's hair and clothing! It uses [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html), modular sections of an Activity, to create a flexible and responsive UI.

This is the toy app for the Fragments lesson of the [Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).
