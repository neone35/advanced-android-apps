# ClassicalMusicQuiz 

    Outdated, not working

This app is simple audio-based quiz where you try to guess the composer by listening to a musical piece! It's your introduction to using  [Android Media Players](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html).

This is the toy app for the Media Playback lesson of the [Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).
